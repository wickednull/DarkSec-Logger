# DarkSec-Logger
DarkSec Logger is a stealthy, mobile-ready tracker that turns any image into an intel tool. It logs real client IPs (proxy-aware), filters bots, and tags hits with unique IDs. With LocalTunnel support, AES-256 log encryption, and a responsive dashboard, itâ€™s built for covert testing and cyber ops on the go.
