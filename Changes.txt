## [2.0] - The Campaign Update

Version 2.0 marks a major architectural shift, transforming the tool from a simple logger into a robust utility for managing distinct tracking campaigns.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Campaign Management**: The core workflow is now centered around campaigns. Users can create, load, and manage separate campaigns, each with its own isolated set of logs and target profiles.
- **Target Profiling**: Within each campaign, users can create unique target profiles with an associated name and notes. This allows for the generation of specific tracking links for different targets.
- **Contextual Logging**: Logs are now automatically enriched with the name of the target profile that clicked the link, providing immediate context.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: All campaigns, profiles, and logs are now automatically saved to a `campaigns.json` file, ensuring data persists between sessions.
- **New "Campaigns" Tab**: A dedicated UI tab was added for creating campaigns and managing target profiles.
- **Active Campaign Selector**: A dropdown menu was added to the "Server Control" tab to easily switch between active campaigns.

### üîÑ Changed
- The application's data is now stored in a `~/.darksec_logger/` directory instead of `~/.config/darksec_logger/`.
- The IP Tools tab is now campaign-aware and sources its IP list from the currently active campaign.

### ‚ùå Removed
- **Standalone Log Files**: The manual "Save Logs as JSON" and "Load Logs from JSON" features have been removed, as this is now handled automatically by the campaign system.
- **Log Encryption**: The feature to save and decrypt encrypted log files has been removed to streamline the new workflow.

## [1.9] - Structured Data & IP Intelligence

This release focused on making the captured data more structured and actionable.

### ‚ú® Added
- **JSON Log Structure**: The logger now captures data as structured JSON objects instead of plain text lines.
- **IP Tools Tab**: A new tab was added to perform **Whois** and **GeoIP** lookups on captured IP addresses.
- **Human-Only Log Filtering (1.9.1)**: The JSON saving feature was refined to automatically exclude traffic from known bots, keeping the saved data clean.

## [1.8] - The Great Refactoring

This was a foundational update that modernized the entire codebase and user interface.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Responsive Tabbed UI**: The original two-row toolbar was replaced with a modern, tabbed interface using `ttk` themed widgets. The layout now scales correctly when the window is resized.
- **Quality of Life Features**: Right-click context menus for **Copy/Paste** were added to all text entry and log display widgets.
- **URL Shortening**: Integrated `pyshorteners` to provide an option for masking tunnel URLs.

### üîÑ Changed
- **Object-Oriented Refactoring**: The entire script was rewritten from a procedural style into a cleaner, more maintainable object-oriented structure centered around a `DarkSecApp` class.
